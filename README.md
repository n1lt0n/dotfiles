# My dotfiles

This a repository of my configuration files for:

1) Neovim
  For neovim, I'm using the kickstart.nvim script. ( https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim )
2) Tmux

# Installation

Neovim:

1) Clone this project and create a symbolic link to the nvim folder:
  $ ln -s ~/path/to/project/nvim/folder ~/.config/nvim
2) After creating symbolic link, run neovim and follow the installation steps provided by the script from kickstart.nvim

Tmux

1) With tmux installed, just copy the content of tmux folder to your user directory.
  $ cd -frv ~/path/to/project/folder/tmux/* ~/
